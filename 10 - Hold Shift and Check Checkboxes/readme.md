# Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes
This is a simple web page that demonstrates the functionality of checking multiple checkboxes by holding the Shift key. It simulates a checklist where users can mark items as completed.

## Features
* When the user clicks a checkbox and holds the Shift key, all checkboxes between the last clicked checkbox and the current one will be checked.
*  Checked checkboxes have a line-through text decoration and a light background color.
*  Users can add their notes below the last item in the checklist. Enter the note in the input field and click "Add Note" to display the note.

## Usage
